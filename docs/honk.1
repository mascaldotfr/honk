.Sh NAME
.Nm honk
.Nd federated status conveyance
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility processes status updates and other microblog activities.
This is the user manual.
For administration, see
.Xr honk 8 .
.Pp
This manual is still incomplete.
It'll get there eventually.
.Ss Following
In order to receive regular updates from other users, one must first follow them.
Begin at the
.Pa honkers
tab.
The
.Ar url
field is required.
Either of two forms are accepted, the user's handle (or webfinger) or their
ActivityPub actor URL.
The
.Ar name
field is optional and will be automatically inferred.
Examples:
.Dl @user@example.social
.Dl https://example.social/users/user
.Pp
.Pp
After following a fellow honker, they may be added to one or more
.Ic combos .
These are accessed via the
.Pa combos
tab and allow easy access to particular groupings.
The special combo name of one hyphen
.Sq -
will remove a honker's posts from the primary feed.
.Ss Viewing
The primary feed is accessed via the home tab.
It will contain posts from all followed honkers.
Posts mentioning the user, both followed and not, are collected under the
.Pa @me
tab.
.Pp
Individual honks contain a visual representation of the honker's ID,
their name, the activity (with a link back to origin), a link to the
parent post if applicable, and the convoy (thread) identifier.
Screenshot below.

Mute this entire thread.
Existing posts are hidden, and future posts will not appear in any feed.
.It Ic zonk
Delete this post.
When deleting one's own post, other servers will be requested to remove it,
but this is unreliable.
.It Ic ack
Acknowledge reading this post.
Typically if it's a reply to one's own post.
.It Ic edit
Change it up.
Alas, Update activities do not federate reliably.

.Ss Honking
Refer to the
.Xr honk 5
section of the manual.
.Ss HFCS
Sometimes other users of the federation can get unruly.
The honk filtering and censorship system,
.Xr hfcs 1 ,
can be of great use to restore order to one's timeline.
