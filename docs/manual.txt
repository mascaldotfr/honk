Instructions for running of the honk.

-- following

In order to follow somebody, you need to enter one of two identifiers.

The easiest is probably their handle, the thing that resembles an email.
@name@example.com for example.

Alternatively, one may directly enter the actor ID, which is a URL that looks
like https://example.com/users/name. Note that the commonly seen URL with
@name in it is not their actor ID and won't work.

Selecting just peeping won't actually follow them. (Incomplete feature.)

-- css

Custom CSS may be provided by creating a views/local.css file.

-- message

A custom server message may be set adding a ('servermsg', 'message') entry to
the config table using sqlite3.

-- emus

Custom emus may be provided by creating and populating the emus directory.
emus may be referenced when composing a honk via colon wrapping. How pleasant.
This :example: will be replaced by emus/example.png.
