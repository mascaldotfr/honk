No attention mining.
No likes, no faves, no polls, no stars, no claps, no counts.

The button to submit a new honk says "it's gonna be honked".

Ein Honk is a stupid person auf deutsch.

-- build

It should be sufficient to type make after unpacking a release.
You'll need a go compiler version 1.11 or later.

Even on a fast machine, building from source can take several seconds.

-- requirements

libsqlite3 (you probably already have it)

go modules included in vendor:
github.com/gorilla/mux
golang.org/x/crypto
golang.org/x/net
humungus.tedunangst.com/r/go-sqlite3

-- setup

honk expects to be fronted by a TLS terminating reverse proxy.

First, create the database.

./honk init

This will ask four questions.
username: (the username you want)
password: (the password you want)
listenaddr: (tcp or unix: localhost:31337, /var/www/honk.sock, etc.)
servername: (public DNS name: honk.example.com)

Then run honk.

./honk

Refer also to the docs directory, in particular manual.txt.

Busy honk instances may use megabytes of memory.

-- upgrade

./honk upgrade

./honk
