Text centric fork of honk, beware many things have been nuked. While it uses
even way less resources than honk proper (no backend needed for starters), i
don't recommend you to use it. If you have any doubt:

DO NOT USE THIS FORK, THIS IS A VERY VERY STUPIDLY STRIPPED DOWN HONK.

Frontend:

- Drop avatar display
- Don't display images for everyone, just put links
- Peaceful dark blue theme with decent contrast, normal font size and color for
  all the honks.
- "Semi material" UI, with CSS flex where needed. As the result it's skinnier
  than vanilla honk and tidier.
- Menu has been simplified, with some links to stuff i don't use removed and is
  inline with the rest of the page. Notably the "places" and "events" feature
  have been totally zapped from the frontend.
- scroll down automatically to the "oldest newest" honk after a refresh

Backend:

- Nodeinfo support so the rest of fediverse knows that honk exists :)
- Progressive web app support so it looks like a native app on smartphones
- Nuke hoot feature (twitter integration)
- Don't save external content, link it with description instead. It's actually
  not a bad idea on a single user instance; you only download attachments that
  you want to see from other instances
- honk's backend has been totally removed, you can't upload attachments, use
  emus, banners, custom avatars etc. As such, funzone has been nuked as well,
  and data/blob.db is non existent.
- API support removed due to previous change, so you can't use bots, and toys
  are gone as well. Could be brought back with a new database schema and
  some code rewrite, but i won't bother.
- Drop filtering, let's live a dangerous life
- Drop import
- Drop chatter
- Drop RSS

=======================================================================

honk

-- features

Take control of your honks and join the federation.
An ActivityPub server with minimal setup and support costs.
Spend more time using the software and less time operating it.

No attention mining.
No likes, no faves, no polls, no stars, no claps, no counts.

Purple color scheme. Custom emus. Memes too.
Avatars automatically assigned by the NSA.

The button to submit a new honk says "it's gonna be honked".

The honk mission is to work well if it's what you want.
This does not imply the goal is to be what you want.

-- build

It should be sufficient to type make after unpacking a release.
You'll need a go compiler version 1.16 or later. And libsqlite3.

Even on a fast machine, building from source can take several seconds.

Development sources: hg clone https://humungus.tedunangst.com/r/honk

-- setup

honk expects to be fronted by a TLS terminating reverse proxy.

First, create the database. This will ask four questions.
./honk init
username: (the username you want)
password: (the password you want)
listenaddr: (tcp or unix: 127.0.0.1:31337, /var/www/honk.sock, etc.)
servername: (public DNS name: honk.example.com)

Then run honk.
./honk

-- upgrade

old-honk backup `date +backup-%F`
./honk upgrade
./honk

-- documentation

There is a more complete incomplete manual. This is just the README.

-- guidelines

One honk per day, or call it an "eighth-tenth" honk.
If your honk frequency changes, so will the number of honks.

The honk should be short, but not so short that you cannot identify it.

The honk is an animal sign of respect and should be accompanied by a
friendly greeting or a nod.

The honk should be done from a seat and in a safe area.

It is considered rude to make noise in a place of business.

The honk may be made on public property only when the person doing
the honk has the permission of the owner of that property.

-- disclaimer

Do not use honk to contact emergency services.
