-- setup

honk expects to be fronted by a TLS terminating reverse proxy.

First, create the database.

./honk init

This will ask four questions.
username: (the username you want)
password: (the password you want)
listenaddr: (tcp or unix: localhost:31337, /var/www/honk.sock, etc.)
servername: (public DNS name: honk.example.com)

Then run honk.

./honk
